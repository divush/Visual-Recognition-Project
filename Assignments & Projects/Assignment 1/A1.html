<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<h2>Instance Recognition</h2>
<b>Problem Statement:</b> Given a dataset of images of several objects your job is to train a model on it such that it is able to retrieve all the instances of a given test object. More specifially the given dataset consists of images of several objects and multiple instances of each object. When tested on an image/object your model's task is to retrieve all instances of the image in the dataset. In other words your model must give a similarity ranking on all images in the dataset such that instances of the object being tested have the highest rankings.
<br><br>
You can divide the given dataset into training and test sets in whichever manner you see fit. Actual testing will be done on an undisclosed dataset.
<br><br>
This assignment will be similar to a competition to see which group does the best. Grading will also be affected by this. We will also have a leader board at the end.
<br><br><br>
<b>Evaluation Metric:</b> Mean Average Precision on the Top K images retrieved (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM6DJ0ZZee0">video explaining MAP</a>)

<b>Dataset:</b> <a href="dataset">dataset</a>
<br><br>
<b>Submission format:</b> A zip file containing all of your code along with a readme file. Also include a report on your approach and any testing results you obtained.
