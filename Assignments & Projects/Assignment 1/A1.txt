Assignment 1

Instance Recognition

Problem Statement: Given a dataset of images of several objects your job is to train a model on it such that it is able to retrieve all the instances of a given test object. More specifially the given dataset consists of images of several objects and multiple instances of each object. When tested on an image/object your model's task is to retrieve all instances of the image in the dataset. In other words your model must give a similarity ranking on all images in the dataset such that instances of the object being tested have the highest rankings. 

You can divide the given dataset into training and test sets in whichever manner you see fit. Actual testing will be done on an undisclosed dataset. 

This assignment will be similar to a competition to see which group does the best. Grading will also be affected by this. We will also have a leader board at the end. 


Evaluation Metric: Mean Average Precision on the Top K images retrieved (video explaining MAP) 
Dataset: dataset
